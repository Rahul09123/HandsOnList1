Description: Write a program to perform Record locking.
a. Implement write lock
b. Implement read lock
Create three records in a file. Whenever you access a particular record, first lock it then modify/access
to avoid race condition.

Note:

ReadRecordLock1 locks the file from byte 12 to 22.
ReadRecordLock2 locks the file from byte 12 to 17.
Since both are read lock so they both can enter into the critical section.

WriteRecordLock1 locks the file from byte 12 to 22.
WriteRecordLock2 locks the file from byte 12 to 17.
Since both are Read lock so they both can't enter into the critical section at the same time.
